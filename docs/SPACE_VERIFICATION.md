## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Space Shows "Building" for Extended Time
- **Cause**: Large dependencies or slow download
- **Solution**: Wait 3-5 minutes; refresh page

### Issue: Application Error on Load
- **Check**: Space logs for Python errors
- **Common Fix**: Verify all module files are present in the Space

### Issue: Module Import Errors
- **Check**: Ensure `modules/__init__.py` exists and exports all classes
- **Fix**: Verify file structure matches deployment guide

### Issue: YAML Files Not Found
- **Check**: `taxonomies/` directory exists with YAML files
- **Fix**: Upload missing taxonomy files

## Performance Notes

- **First Load**: May take 10-30 seconds to initialize
- **Subsequent Requests**: Should be fast (<2 seconds)
- **Large Reports**: Generation may take 3-5 seconds

## Sharing Your Space

Once verified, you can:
1. **Share the URL**: https://huggingface.co/spaces/cybercentinel/ai-red-teaming
2. **Embed in Portfolio**: Use the embed code from Space settings
3. **Link in Resume**: Add to projects section
4. **Demonstrate in Interview**: Show live functionality

## Monitoring

### Check Space Health
1. Visit the Space URL
2. Click "Logs" tab (if available) to see runtime output
3. Monitor for any error messages

### Update Space
```bash
cd ai-red-teaming
# Make changes to files
git add .
git commit -m "Your update message"
git push
```

## Success Criteria

Your Space is fully functional when:
- ✅ No errors in application logs
- ✅ All 5 tabs load and respond
- ✅ Test scenarios produce expected results
- ✅ Reports generate successfully
- ✅ Interface is responsive and user-friendly

## Next Steps After Verification

1. **Test Thoroughly**: Try various inputs in all tabs
2. **Document Results**: Screenshot successful tests for portfolio
3. **Optimize**: If needed, improve performance or UI
4. **Promote**: Share with potential employers or on LinkedIn
5. **Iterate**: Add new features based on feedback
