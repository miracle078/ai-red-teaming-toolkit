## ‚ö° Quick Reference

### When Someone Asks About Your Projects

**Elevator Pitch (30 seconds):**
"I built an AI Red-Teaming Toolkit that security teams can use to test Large Language Models for vulnerabilities. It includes 17 different attack patterns, automatically classifies findings using OWASP and MITRE frameworks, and generates professional security reports. It's deployed live on Hugging Face Spaces and all the code is on GitHub."

**Technical Deep-Dive (2 minutes):**
"The toolkit has four core modules written in Python. The jailbreak tester implements 9 attack patterns like DAN and role-play exploits. The prompt injection module detects 8 types of injection attacks. The vulnerability classifier maps findings to OWASP LLM Top 10 and MITRE ATLAS frameworks, with CVSS scoring. The report generator creates reproducible documentation. I built a Gradio interface for it and deployed it to Hugging Face Spaces. You can test it live or review the source code on GitHub."

**Why It Matters:**
"As AI systems become more prevalent in enterprise environments, red-teaming capabilities are critical for security validation. This toolkit demonstrates my ability to implement adversarial testing methodologies, integrate security frameworks, and build production-ready tools for AI safety assessment."
